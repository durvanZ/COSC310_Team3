# COSC310_Team3

  We created a chatbot to serve the customers of an online clothing store. Essentially, a customer service chatbot was created using artificial intelligence and machine learning following agile SDLC methodologies. 
  
  Our software consists of two input JSON files used to train the neural network and make personalized answers based on customer information. The training.py imports data from intents.py and trains the neural network. training.py outputs words and classes pk1 files, which are used by the predict.py module to estimate the probability that a user input addresses a particular topic in the intents.JSON. A random response from the most likely topic is outputted by the chatbot. At the current stage, the chatbot is able to estimate the topic, and fully conversational functionality is still under development.
